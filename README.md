#Primes

####Just a small project playing around with finding and checking primes in Pascal.

###Programs so far:
  PrimeChecker checks whether a number is prime
  SieveOfEratosthenes outputs all primes between 1 and an input limit
  FindPrimeFactors finds all the prime factors of a number

Now working on more efficient algorithms for finding primes.
